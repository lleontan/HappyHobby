## Problem Statement
Boredom is a frequent emotion that can lead to an increase in mental health issues. The consequences of not having something to do lead to “[depression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression), [substance abuse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction), absenteeism from work or school, reduced job satisfaction, and even a general sense that life has no meaning.” Boredom typically persists because people struggle to find a hobby to keep them satisfied. Due to situations like a world pandemic resulting in many people isolating themselves, we would like to focus on people who live alone, regardless of their age. Individuals who live alone are most prone to depression than those who live with others. Current solutions mostly just include web pages with a list of different hobbies they can try each day. Since there are too many hobbies the user can pick from at once, it can be a bit overwhelming to choose one. There is no incentive or community support for them to record their progress or stay motivated either.
