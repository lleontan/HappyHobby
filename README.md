## Problem Statement
Boredom is a frequent emotion that can lead to an increase in mental health issues. The consequences of not having something to do lead to “[depression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression), [substance abuse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction), absenteeism from work or school, reduced job satisfaction, and even a general sense that life has no meaning.” Boredom typically persists because people struggle to find a hobby to keep them satisfied. With a web application connecting people to enjoy fun new-found hobbies and interests, we can harness the connective power of technology to break down the mental barriers stopping people from starting new hobbies.
